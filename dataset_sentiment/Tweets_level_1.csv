720,570129828969459712,negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
721,570126668922294272,positive,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer

758,570095499287506946,positive,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
759,570095172303900672,negative,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
761,570092741654401024,negative,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"

776,570085448271335424,negative,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
777,570085056401838081,negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
778,570083898031513600,negative,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B

814,570067529206358016,negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
815,570067181733580800,negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.

1493,569698949474291713,negative,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
1494,569698788216049664,negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
1495,569698504467021824,negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing

1502,569696313824161792,negative,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
1503,569695553644322816,negative,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
1504,569695452368670720,negative,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.

1513,569689096882425857,negative,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
1514,569689076439392257,negative,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.

1524,569683567552262145,negative,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
1525,569681831039074306,negative,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
1526,569681799984492544,negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
1527,569681746037383168,negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
1528,569681499928158208,positive,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"

1531,569679871707783168,negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1532,569679642447052800,negative,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
